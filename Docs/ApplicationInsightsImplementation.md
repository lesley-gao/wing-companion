# Application Insights Implementation Summary

## Overview
Completed comprehensive Application Insights configuration for the Flight Companion & Pickup Platform, providing enterprise-grade monitoring, logging, and performance tracking capabilities.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Infrastructure Configuration
- **monitoring.bicep**: Enhanced with environment-specific Application Insights setup
- **Environment-specific settings**:
  - Development: 50% sampling, 5GB daily cap, 7-day retention
  - Test: 100% sampling, 10GB daily cap, 30-day retention
  - Production: 100% sampling, 50GB daily cap, 90-day retention

### 2. Application Integration
- **Program.cs**: Configured Application Insights SDK with telemetry collection
- **NuGet packages**: Added Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore (2.22.0)
- **Logging integration**: Connected Application Insights with ILogger
- **Performance counters**: Enabled system and custom performance monitoring

### 3. Custom Telemetry Service
- **TelemetryService.cs**: Business-specific metrics and event tracking
- **Tracked events**:
  - User registration and authentication
  - Payment processing and failures
  - Flight/pickup matching events
  - Emergency contact usage
  - Document verification status

### 4. Monitoring & Alerts
- **Smart detection**: Automatic anomaly detection for performance issues
- **Custom alerts**:
  - Database connection failures
  - Payment processing failures
  - Authentication failures
  - Low user activity warnings
- **Business metrics dashboard**: KQL-based workbook for operational insights

### 5. Security Integration
- **Key Vault integration**: Secure Application Insights connection string storage
- **Environment variables**: Secure configuration management
- **Role-based access**: Proper Azure RBAC for monitoring resources

### 6. Management Automation
- **Manage-ApplicationInsights.ps1**: Comprehensive PowerShell script for:
  - Resource deployment and validation
  - Health monitoring and alerting
  - Performance testing and optimization
  - Data export and backup capabilities

## Configuration Files Updated
