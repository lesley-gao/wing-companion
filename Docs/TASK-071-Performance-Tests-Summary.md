  - Concurrent request handling tests
  - Memory usage analysis
  - Database scaling validation

### 4. Load Testing with NBomber
- **Files**:

  - `Tests/Performance/LoadTestRunner.cs`
- **Purpose**: High-load scenario testing
- **Features**:
  - Simulated concurrent user loads
  - HTTP endpoint stress testing
  - Mixed workload testing
  - Performance threshold validation

### 5. Benchmark Runner Utility
- **File**: `Tests/Performance/BenchmarkRunner.cs`
- **Purpose**: Utility to execute BenchmarkDotNet tests
- **Features**: Automated benchmark execution with report generation

## Performance Criteria Established

### Matching Algorithm Performance
- **Flight Companion Matching**: < 500ms average, < 1000ms 95th percentile
- **Pickup Matching**: < 300ms average, < 750ms 95th percentile
- **Concurrent Processing**: 20 requests in < 3000ms total
- **Memory Usage**: < 50MB increase per 100 operations

### Database Query Performance
- **Simple Queries**: < 500ms for user operations
- **Complex Filtered Queries**: < 1000ms for flight/pickup searches
- **Pagination**: < 3x performance degradation for later pages
- **Batch Operations**: Faster than individual operations

### Load Testing Thresholds
- **Flight Companion API**: 10-15 req/sec sustained load
- **Pickup Matching API**: 8-15 req/sec sustained load
- **Mixed Workload**: 15+ req/sec overall throughput
- **Error Rate**: < 5% failure rate under load

## Test Data Generation
- **Users**: 1000 test users with varied ratings and verification status
- **Flight Requests/Offers**: 500 each with realistic flight data
- **Pickup Requests/Offers**: 300 each with airport and capacity variations
- **Deterministic**: Fixed random seed for consistent benchmarking

## Package Dependencies Added
```xml
<PackageReference Include="BenchmarkDotNet" Version="0.14.0" />
<PackageReference Include="NBomber" Version="6.0.0" />
```

## Test Execution Commands

### MSTest Performance Tests
```bash
dotnet test Tests --filter Category=Performance
```

### Load Tests
```bash
dotnet test Tests --filter Category=LoadTest
```

### BenchmarkDotNet Tests
```csharp
// From test code
BenchmarkRunner.RunBenchmarks();
```

## Performance Monitoring Features
- Statistical reporting (min, max, average, median, P95, P99)
- Memory usage tracking with GC analysis
- Throughput measurements (requests/second)
- Response time distribution analysis
- Failure rate monitoring under load

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure
- Uses existing `ApplicationDbContext` and models
- Compatible with existing `IMatchingService` interface
- Leverages `WebApplicationFactory` for HTTP testing
- Works with in-memory database for isolated testing

## Expected Performance Characteristics
Based on the test infrastructure, the system should handle:
- **Small-scale**: 10-20 concurrent users with sub-second response times
- **Medium-scale**: 50-100 concurrent users with 1-2 second response times
- **Database**: Efficient querying of 1000+ records with proper indexing
- **Memory**: Stable memory usage without significant leaks

## Future Enhancements
- Add Redis caching performance tests
- Implement database index optimization tests
- Create real-world load testing scenarios
- Add API rate limiting performance validation
- Implement continuous performance monitoring

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - TASK-071 performance testing infrastructure is fully implemented and ready for execution.

The performance test suite provides comprehensive coverage of matching algorithms, database operations, and system load handling, ensuring the NetworkingApp platform can scale effectively while maintaining responsive user experience.
